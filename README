There are two main programs that make up the software. The first
program, calc_bkgd, takes recombination rates, the locations of
conserved segments under purifying selection and some parameters that
define the distribution of selection coefficients. Using these data
the program estimates a B value for every location in the genome.

The second program, bkgd_mle, takes a set of 5-species multiple
alignments and B values and performs maximum likelihood estimation of
several evolutionary parameters including the ancestral effective
populations sizes, mutation rates and rescaling factor for the
selection coefficients.

Currently, the code is not very usable by other people. The main issue
is that it is written to retrieve conserved sites and recombination
rates from a mysql database which I used at UW. The code that
retrieves data from the database is in a separate library, which I
also wrote (I can provide this to you if you wish). My plan is to
strip the database components from the background selection code, and
to make it read features and recombination rates from user-provided
files instead.

The code also depends on several external libraries. I use glibc for
several datastructures (e.g. hashtables, linked lists, stacks), and I
use the gnu scientific library (gsl) for numerical integration and
function minimization. I've also been using scons (www.scons.org) to
build my code, rather than traditional makefiles.

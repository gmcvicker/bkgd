This directory contains Background selection (B) value estimates
computed for the human genome. These estimates used the locations of
'gcons' conserved segments (score > 10) described in the paper and a
finescale recombination map (Myers et al. 2005).  B-values were
computed on the NCBI36/hg18 version of the human genome assembly and
subsequently lifted-over to the hg19 and hg38 assemblies.

Parameter values used to compute these B-values are from maximum
likelihood estimates from 5-species (HCGOM) data for autosomes and
2-species (HC) data for chromosome X as described in McVicker et
al. 2009.

This directory contains B values for hg18. The .bkgd files are in the original
file format output by the calc_bkgd program. In this format, each line
contains two space-separated values. The first value is the
B value rounded to three decimal places and multiplied by 1000 (ranges
from 0-1000). The second value is the length of the segment in bp. For
example, the file chr10.bkgd begins with the lines: 
835 18021 
830 18467
824 18015 
This indicates that chromosome 10 begins with a run of 18021
bases with B value 0.835 followed by 18467 bases with B-value
0.830, etc.

The bkgd_hg18.bed.gz contains B-values in BED file format.
